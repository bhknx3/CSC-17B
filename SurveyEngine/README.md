# Survey Engine

## Description
Website containing a survey tool.

Contains separate admin/user interfaces.

Implementation was focused on a setting where an organization can create, send surveys and view results. Thus, admins have the ability to create and send surveys while users must login to take a survey.

When creating a survey, the number of questions and answers can be dynamically added or deleted. This allows for a more customizable experience for the survey creator.

## Purpose
To practice web development and become familiarized with concepts such as:
* MVC pattern
* JSON
* Database management
* Form validation using regular expressions
* Login/Logout system
* Cookies
* Sessions
* Securing pages
